## Project Overview

This project is a geo-visualization and lead qualification tool designed for sales and marketing teams working in the food equipment sector, particularly for ITW-FEG products. The regions of **Dijon** and **Beaune** in France were selected as a pilot area to map potential B2B leads such as:

* **Restaurants**
* **EHPADs** (retirement homes)
* **Schools and Colleges**

The project leverages a filtered dataset and provides an **interactive map** and **heatmap layer** to visually assess geographical lead density and category segmentation.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Folium Map**: Establishments displayed with category-based icons and popups.
* **Heatmap Layer**: Highlights areas with high lead concentration.
* **Custom Popups**: Show name, address, postal code, and category.
* **Category Color Coding**: Different colors for restaurants, rest homes, schools, etc.
* **CRM-Ready**: Dataset is structured for seamless integration with CRM platforms like **Microsoft Dynamics**.

## Usage Goals

* Enable pre-CRM **lead discovery** and prioritization.
* Provide visual **sales intelligence** for field teams.
* Empower sales agents to **update and qualify** leads (future feature).

## Future Enhancements

* Authenticated form-based lead update system.
* Qualification workflow and validation.
* CRM automation with Power Automate or Dynamics 365 API.
* Additional filters and time-based analytics.

## Project Structure

* `create_map.py` â€“ Python code to generate the interactive map and heat layer.
* `dashaboard_generator.py` â€“ Visualization and category distribution comparison.
* `convertLambertWgs84.py` â€“ Coordinate conversion from Lambert-93 to WGS84.
